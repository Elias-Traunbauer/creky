## Overview

Welcome to creky, a collaborative project developed by Elias Traunbauer for cracking encrypted messages. This project employs a distributed computing approach, utilizing a server-client model to distribute brute force tasks across multiple PCs, enhancing the efficiency and speed of the decryption process.

## Features

- **Distributed Computing**: Leverages multiple PCs to distribute and process decryption tasks.
- **Server-Client Model**: Utilizes a server to manage and allocate blocks of work to various clients.
- **Brute Force Methodology**: Employs brute force techniques to systematically decrypt messages.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to scale with the addition of more client machines, increasing decryption capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a suitable environment for running server and client applications.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Elias-Traunbauer/creky.git
   ```
2. Set up the server and client applications on respective machines as per the provided instructions.

### Usage

- The server application manages and distributes work, while the client applications process assigned decryption tasks. Further instructions on operation and configuration will be provided in the documentation.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve efficiency, add features, or enhance the scalability of creky are welcomed and appreciated.

## License

The project is open-source, with details available in the `LICENSE` file.
